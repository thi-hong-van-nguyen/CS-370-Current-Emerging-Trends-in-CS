# CS-370-Current-Emerging-Trends-in-CS

### Project explanation
- I was given two fundamental classes: "GameExperience" and "TreasureMaze." The "GameExperience" class functions as a repository for storing episodes of the agent's experiences in memory. This class plays a pivotal role in managing these episodes, offering capabilities to predict the agent's next actions based on its current environmental state, as well as retrieving essential data for training the neural network model. On the other hand, the "TreasureMaze" class defines the intricate environment of the game within a maze structure. It tracks the movements and actions of the agent, assigns rewards according to the agent's behavior, and evaluates the overall game status. Furthermore, this class provides methods for observing the present environmental state and rendering a visual representation of the maze.

- My task was to complete the "qtrain" function, designed for training a reinforcement learning model in navigating a maze. This function accepts inputs, including a neural network model, the maze environment, and optional parameters. It leverages an experience replay mechanism to train the model and enhance the agent's navigation skills. Throughout the training process, the agent systematically explores the maze, maintaining a balance between exploration and exploitation in making decisions. The function tracks training progress over a predetermined number of epochs, reporting various statistics like loss, episode count, win count, and win rate. The training cycle continues until reaching a predefined win rate or attaining a maximum number of training epochs. 

### Computer scientists and their role
Throughout this course, I learned that computer scientists are central to a multifaceted field that encompasses algorithm design, software development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, computer security, and human-computer interaction. Their work holds immense importance as it drives technological progress, fuels economic growth, provides solutions to intricate problems, fosters global interconnectedness, enhances efficiency across industries, and spawns entirely new fields. Beyond their technical expertise, computer scientists also engage in research and education, addressing ethical concerns and advocating for the responsible use of technology to benefit society, thus solidifying their pivotal role in shaping our increasingly digital world.

### Approach a problem as a computer scientist
If I were a computer scientist, I would tackle problems through a structured process. My first step would be gaining a deep understanding of the problem and gathering all necessary requirements. This would be followed by thorough research and careful planning. I'd then break the problem into smaller, more manageable parts and select the most suitable algorithms and data structures. Before writing any actual code, I'd create a logical outline using pseudocode or flowcharts to ensure a clear path forward. My coding would emphasize clean and modular code, and rigorous testing and debugging to catch and fix issues. If necessary, I'd work on optimization for better performance. Comprehensive documentation, version control, and peer reviews would be integral to maintain code quality. The solution would undergo validation, considering factors like scalability, security, and ethical considerations. Preparing for deployment and maintenance would be a priority, always with an eye on gathering feedback, iterating for improvements, and continually learning from the experience to enhance future problem-solving endeavors.

### Ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization
I would emphasize ethical responsibilities both to end users and the organization as a technology professional. In regard to end users, this means protecting their privacy and data security, ensuring transparency and informed consent, prioritizing user safety, accessibility, and a positive user experience, and upholding fairness in AI and algorithms. For the organization, it involves maintaining honesty and integrity, avoiding conflicts of interest, safeguarding intellectual property, adhering to policies and compliance, and responsibly using resources. Ethical decision-making and a commitment to professional development play a pivotal role in balancing the interests of end users with those of the organization, while legal compliance and environmental responsibility are also essential considerations in ethical tech practice.
